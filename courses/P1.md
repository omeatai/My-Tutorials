### [1-100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 - ANGELA YU](/courses/1.md)

<details>
  <summary>1. Introduction - Print Function </summary>

# Example 1:

```py
# input() will get user input in console
# Then print() will print the word "Hello" and the user input
print("Hello + input("What is your name?"))
```

```py
# What is your name? Bob
# Hello Bob
```

# Example 2:

```py
#This code prints the number of characters in a user's name.
print(len input ("What is your name?") ) )
```

```py
# What is your name? Bob
# 3
```

# Example 3:

```py
name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)
```

```py
# What is your name? Mark
# Mark
```

# Task 1:

```py
#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the band name generator.")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
# https://band-name-generator-end.appbrewery.repl.run/
```

```py
# Welcome to the band name generator.
# Which city did you grow up in?
# Bristol
# What is the name of a pet?
# Rabbit
# Your band name could be  Bristol Rabbit
```

  <summary>2. Number Manipulation </summary>

# Example 1:

Rounding Numbers -

```py
print(round(8 / 3, 2))
```

```py
# 2.67
```

# Example 2:

Flooring Numbers -

```py
print(8 // 3)
```

```py
# 2
```

# Example 3:

```py
result = 4 / 2
result /= 2
print(result)
```

```py
# 1.0
```

# Example 4:

```py
score = 0
score += 1
print(score)
```

```py
# 1
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Using F Strings </summary>

# Example 1:

```py
score = 0
print("your score is " + str(score))
```

```py
score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
#f-String
print (f"your score is {score}")
```

```py
# your score is 0
```

# Example 2:

```py
score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
#f-String
print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}")
```

```py
# your score is 0, your height is 1.8, you are winning is True
```

# Example 3:

```py
age = input("What is your current age? ")

rem = (90 - int(age))
d =  rem * 365
w = rem * 52
m = rem * 12

print(f"You have {d} days, {w} weeks, and {m} months left.")
```

```py
# What is your current age? 35
# You have 20075 days, 2860 weeks, and 660 months left.
```

# Example 4:

Using the Format function -

```py
format(salesAmount, '.2f')
```

Using the Format Method:

```py
"{:.2f}".format(salesAmount)
```

# Task 1:

```py
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill?\n$"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?\n"))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?\n"))
bill_with_tip = (tip/100+1) * bill
bill_for_each_person = "{:.2f}".format(bill_with_tip/people)
print(f'Each person should pay: ${bill_for_each_person}.')
```

```py
# Welcome to the tip calculator!
# What was the total bill?
# $150.00
# How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?
# 12
# How many people to split the bill?
# 5
# Each person should pay: $33.60.
```

  <summary>4. If Else Statements </summary>

# Example 1:

```py
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height > 120:
	print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
else:
	print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
```

```py
# Welcome to the rollercoaster!
# What is your height in cm? 180
# You can ride the rollercoaster!
```

# Example 2:

```py
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))

if number%2 == 0:
    print('This is an even number.')
else:
    print('This is an odd number.')
```

```py
# Which number do you want to check? 51
# This is an odd number.
```

# Example 3:

Nested If/Else -

```

```py
# Welcome to the rollercoaster!
# What is your height in cm? 180
# You can ride the rollercoaster!
# What is your age? 19

```

```py
# Welcome to the rollercoaster!
# What is your height in cm? 180
# You can ride the rollercoaster!
# What is your age? 11
# Please pay $5.
```

# Example 5:

```py

bmi = round(weight / height**2)

if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")

## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
#user_cards = []
#computer_cards = []

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
#and returns the score.
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
